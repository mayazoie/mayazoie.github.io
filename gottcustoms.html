            <h2>GottCustoms</h2>
            <h3>Custom Merchandise</h3>
            <p>
                One day, while sick in bed, I was doodling on my iPad when my boyfriend asked me to design a piece of clothing for him to wear for his college's rivalry basketball game.
                His friends absolutely loved what I made for him and started begging me to make stuff for them and their fraternity!
            </p>
            <p>
                From there, <a href="gottcustoms.html">GottCustoms</a> was born!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have since made everything ranging from t-shirts, hoodies, and sweatpants to posters and flags to trucker hats and graduation caps.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Again, the name "<a href="gottcustoms.html">GottCustoms</a>" is extremely near and dear to my heart.
                Like "<a href="gottphotos.html">GottPhotos</a>," I was inspired by my nickname and love for dairy products.
                I am beyond ecstatic and grateful to continue to use this name on my store today.
            </p>
            <p>
                I even designed my logo with my aforementioned inspiration in mind. 
                It is indeed a milk carton combined with a clothes hanger; the perfect representation of "gotmilk?" and a symbol of my custom merchandise!
            </p>
            <p>
                My main sales channel is <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/GottCustoms">Etsy</a>.
                But I also have a <a href="https://gottcustoms.com/">Shopify</a> and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gottcustoms/">Instagram</a> dedicated to my brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, because I am passionate about the environment, I ensure that my merchandise and distribution methods are eco-friendly and sustainable. 
            </p>
