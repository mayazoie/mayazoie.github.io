        <h1>About me: Maya Gottlieb</h1>

        <p>
            Hi! ðŸ˜ƒ My name is Maya Gottlieb. I am majoring in Visual and Documentary Journalism, and minoring in Climate Science and Policy.
            I am originally from Ft. Lauderdale, FL. I am a sophomore transfer student, and this is my second semester at the University of Miami.
            This is my <strong>first time ever coding anything!</strong> ðŸ«£ I love Graphic Design, though! And I took a class on it last semester.
        </p>

        <p>
            Anyway, I hope you enjoy my Project 1: Web Basics, in which you will get to know me a little bit better! ðŸ˜ƒ
        </p>
       
        <h2>How I Chose My Major</h2>

        <p>
            Growing up in Florida, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by sunshine and warm weather year round. But my favorite aspect
            of Florida is by far the water. I have always been drawn to the ocean. And so, when applying to college, I knew I wanted to study
            some sort of marine-related science.
        </p>

        <h3>Applying to College</h3>

        <p>
            I applied to college while in COVID-19 lockdown, so, naturally, I wanted to get far away from home. After some virtual tours and
            short conversations with friends who attend the universities I was considering, I decided on Washington University in St. Louis.
            There, I was majoring in Marine Biology on the pre-veterinary track. I ultimately switched to the Business of Entertainment.
            But we will get into that later. Anyway, I'm sure you can guess how I felt when I experienced my first winter ðŸ¥¶ ... I am a transfer student, after all.
        </p>

        <h3>How College Started</h3>

        <p>
            After about a semester, I knew I was not going to survive the remainder of my college experience in St. Louis.
            In addition to my major being canceled (<em>yes, canceled!</em>), I absolutely hated the cold weather and the lack of beaches.
            So, I began my transfer process. In the meantime, though, I did try to make the most of WashU.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have always been a creative person; I grew up loving all aspects and types of art. But I have always preferred digital art!
            More specifically, I love photography and videography. Knowing this, I began taking classes like the following:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Course Code</th>
                <th>Course Name</th>
                <th>Credit Hours</th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>COM 330</td>
                <td>Introduction to Photojournalism</td>
                <td>3.00</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>FIL 220</td>
                <td>Film Studies</td>
                <td>3.00</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>CW 206</td>
                <td>Navigating New Media</td>
                <td>3.00</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>How College is Going</h3>
        
        <p>
            While taking the aforementioned classes, I realized I loved photography and videography more than I had previously known. And I really enjoyed learning more about these topics that I had already found interesting and compelling.
            So much so that I redeclared my major to be the Business of Entertainment, and decided I wanted to combine my passions and one day work as a climate or travel photographer or videographer for a company like National Geographic!
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, when applying to transfer schools, I looked for universities that had the following qualities:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>great weather</li>
            <li>an amazing journalism program</li>
            <li>a great marine science program</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Obviously, the ðŸ™Œ is the best of the best in all three aspects (and many more, too!), so I applied, packed my bags, and headed back home to Florida!
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, I am beyond happy at my new school, studying exactly what I want, and enjoying the most beautiful weather year-round. ðŸ˜ƒ
