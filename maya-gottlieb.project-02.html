                <h2>Background 📚</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least 60,000 years ago and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral histories.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dutch 🇳🇱 navigators led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> were the first Europeans to land in Australia in <time datetime="1606">1606</time>, and they mapped the western and northern coasts.
                    They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently settle it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In <time datetime="1770">1770</time>, English captain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook">James Cook</a> sailed to the east coast of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain.
                    In <time datetime="1788">1788</time> and <time datetime="1825">1825</time>, Great Britain established New South Wales and then Tasmania as penal colonies, respectively.
                    Great Britain and Ireland 🇮🇪 sent more than 150,000 convicts to Australia before ending the practice in <time datetime="1868">1868</time>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As Europeans began settling areas away from the coasts, they came into more direct contact with Aboriginal Australians.
                    Europeans also cleared land for agriculture, impacting Aboriginal Australians’ ways of life.
                    These issues, along with disease and a policy in the <time datetime="1900">1900</time>s that forcefully removed Aboriginal children from their parents, reduced the Aboriginal Australian population from more than 700,000 pre-European contact to a low of 74,000 in <time datetime="1933">1933</time>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Four additional colonies were established in Australia in the mid-<time datetime="1800">1800</time>s: Western Australia (<time datetime="1829">1829</time>), South Australia (<time datetime="1836">1836</time>), Victoria (<time datetime="1851">1851</time>), and Queensland (<time datetime="1859">1859</time>).
                    Gold rushes beginning in the <time datetime="1850">1850</time>s brought thousands of new immigrants to New South Wales and Victoria, helping to reorient Australia away from its penal colony roots.
                    In the second half of the <time datetime="1800">1800</time>s, the colonies were all gradually granted self-government, and in <time datetime="1901">1901</time>, they federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Australia contributed more than 400,000 troops to Allied efforts during World War <data value="1">I</data>, and Australian troops played a large role in the defeat of Japanese 🇯🇵 troops in the Pacific in World War <data value="2">II</data>.
                    Australia severed most constitutional links with the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> 🇬🇧 in 1942, but remained part of the British Commonwealth. 
                    In <time datetime="2021">2021</time>, Australia, the UK, and the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> 🇺🇸 announced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUKUS"><abbr title="Australia-UK-US">AUKUS</abbr></a> enhanced trilateral security partnership to maintain and expand the three countries’ edge in military capabilities and critical technologies.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    Australia’s post-war economy boomed and by the <time datetime="1970">1970</time>s, racial policies that prevented most non-Whites from immigrating to Australia were removed, greatly increasing Asian immigration to the country.
                    In recent decades, Australia has become an internationally competitive, advanced market economy due in large part to economic reforms adopted in the <time datetime="1980">1980</time>s and its proximity to East and Southeast Asia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the early <time datetime="2000">2000</time>s, Australian politics became unstable with frequent attempts to oust party leaders, including five changes of prime minister between <time datetime="2010">2010</time> and <time datetime="2018">2018</time>.
                    As a result, both major parties instituted rules to make it harder to remove a party leader.

                        Australia is generally arid to semiarid, receiving around 25 to 50 <abbr title="centimeters">cm</abbr> of rainfall annually. 
                        It is temperate in the south and east, with relatively moderate mean annual temperatures above 10°C in the warmest months and above −3°C in the colder months.
                        And it is tropical in the north, featuring hot temperatures and humid conditions all year round.

                    <p>
                        As of <time datetime="2023">2023</time>, Australia's population is estimated to be 26,461,166.
                        This is based on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about future trends from the US Bureau of the Census.
                        The total population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country on the world and within its region.

                    <h3>Population Distribution</h3>

                    <p>
                        Australia's population is primarily located on the periphery, with the highest concentration of people residing in the east and southeast.
                        A secondary population center is located in and around Perth in the west.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Of the States and Territories, New South Wales has, by far, the largest population.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        The interior, or "outback", has a very sparse population.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This provides merely a summary description of the population dispersion within Australia.
                        While it may suggest population density, it does not provide density figures.

                    <h3>Urbanization</h3>

                    <p>
                        There are two measures of the degree of urbanization of a population:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>urban population</strong> - the percentage of the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the country</li>
                        <li><strong>rate of urbanization</strong> - the projected average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the given period of time</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        It is possible for a country with a 100% urban population to still display a change in the rate of urbanization (up or down).
                        For example, a population of 100,000 that is 100% urban can change in size to 110,000 or 90,000 but remain 100% urban.
